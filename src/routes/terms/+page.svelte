                        making an investment decision, you should read the
                        relevant offer document and (if appropriate) seek

                        Any managed investment fund product (<strong

                        information memorandum which contains all the details of

                        any investment in the Fund you should consider the
                        information memorandum in full. An investment may
                        achieve a lower than expected return and investors risk

                        performance is no indication of future performance.
